I﻿ was in a fitness rut, I had barely exercised in what felt like years when a friend said he had signed up to Hyrox ...

I was incapable of doing 3 pushups, and unable to run a mile ... 

Since then I have learnt a lot in my journey into functional fitness and hopefully you can learn something too.

This site aims to help people new to fitness racing as well as those who are experienced looking to improve their performance.

The pages are easily digestible.

I hope you find the site useful and we would love to hear any feedback.

I﻿n life, it's important to ocassionally throw yourself outside of your comfort zone; Into something scary perhaps. It's only when you push yourself do you find where that line really exists. 

Go for it!
