I﻿ was in a fitness rut, I had barely exercised in what felt like years when a friend said he had signed up to Hyrox ...

I have learnt a lot in my journey in functional fitness already and hopefully you can find some use from this site.

This site aims to help people with that are new to fitness racing and as well as those looking to improve in events such as Hyrox.

I hope you find the website useful.

I﻿n life, it's important to ocassionally throw yourself outside of your comfort zone. Only when you push yourself do you find where your line really exists. 

G﻿o for it!\
