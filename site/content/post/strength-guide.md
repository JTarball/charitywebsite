Strength Cycle

The real categories for basic strength:

* Vertical Pull
* Horizontal Pull
* Vertical Push
* Horizontal Push
* Core Strength

Don't overcomplicate select one or two from each 

* Aim for small increment changes 
* Consider the occasional variations: single leg strength, slow eccentrics 

# Vertical Pulls

## Weighted Pull Ups

There’s really no good excuse for this to not have the top spot: They hit the most muscle mass, they allow for the safest progression, and they use a larger ROM for all the relevant muscles except rhomboids and mid-traps.

There are two grip orientations that are high yield: neutral and pronated. The differences are minor, but if you can do both without issues than using the pronated grip will give you slightly more carryover.

There are also two grip widths that you should be using: Regular and wide grip positions.

Goals for each rep:

* Keep a neutral spine
* Engain your back muscles by retracting your scapula
* Reach a full hang at the bottom of each rep
* DO NOT focus on getting your chest to touch the bar at the top

### Regression

If you can't perform weighted pullups 

* Negative Weighted Pullups
* Pullups
* Negative Pullups
* Scapula Pullups
* Bodyweight Rows

### Progression

Assisted One-Arm Pullup

# Horizontal Pulls

## Bent-over Row

This exercise is a great one for building sled pull strength.

## Kroc Row

\## Chin up

A variation of the pullups were you using a supinated grip (facing you).

Generally for most people this is easier than the pullup given the movement engages your biceps more.

# Vertical Push

## Overhead Press / Strict Press

## Seated Dumbbell Shoulder Press

\## Arnold Press

\## Landmine Press

# Horizontal Push

## Pushup

### Progression

* Pseudo Planche Pushup
* Hand Release Pushups

### Regression

* Knee Pushups

# Posterior Chain

## Rack Pulls

The top exercise for the posterior chain is the deadlift however given the risks associated with the exercise I prefer rack pulls. Unless you are someone that trains competitively in deadlifts or has a lot of experience (and thus good technque) the risk to reward ratio is far too high. Noone wants a lower back injury, its far safer to do a romanian deadlift or a rackpull.

Rack Pull is essentially a deadlift variation where you perform the top part of the movement.

Goals for each rep:

* Position the barbell on a squat rack just above the knee
* Inhale, bend your knees slightly when gripping the bar and lift
* Hold the weight at the top
* Keep your back straight when lowering

## Good Mornings

\## Pullups

Although stated in above in the vertical pull section, pullups are a great way to strength your upper posterior chain.

Quick Start

* Minimize the number of exercises for simplicity
* You want to look for small incremental strength gains by increasing load
* Improve technique in the exercises overtime

Remember ensure you get your calories, recovery and protein in!
