## What shoes should you wear 

Hyrox being sponsored by Puma you will find a lot of people recommending them (I am not going to). 

Lets keep this simple, do not wear Nike vaporflys or any running shoes that has a foam sole as you will not have enough grip required for pushing the sled on the hyrox carpet.

### Summary

* Any normal running shoes we would work. 
* No Nike ZoomX / [Vaporflys](https://www.nike.com/gb/running/vaporfly)
* No metcon shoes it's not crossfit!



Test out your shoes with Hyrox Level Weight or higher on the sled in the gym. Done!

I personally love the nike pegasus series, no nonsense ... good to run and gets the job done.
