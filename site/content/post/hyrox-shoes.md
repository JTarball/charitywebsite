## What shoes should you wear

Hyrox being sponsored by Puma you will find a lot of people recommending them (I am not going to). 

Lets keep this simple, do not wear Nike vaporflys or any running shoes that have a foam sole as you will not have enough grip required for pushing the sled on the hyrox carpet.

### Summary

* Any normal running shoes we would work. 
* No Nike ZoomX / [Vaporflys](https://www.nike.com/gb/running/vaporfly)
* No metcon shoes it's not crossfit!

Test out your shoes with Hyrox Level Weight or higher on the sled in the gym. Done.

You can go wrong with the pegasus series. Good to run in, no nonsense and get the job done.
