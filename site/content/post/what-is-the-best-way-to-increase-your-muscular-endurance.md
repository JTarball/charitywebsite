You will need muscular endurance in order to survive the sandbag lunges and wall balls. You will also need to decide when its best to train for muscular endurance.. skipping that hard decision, here's how you might do it.

How do you actually increase your muscular endurance (In no particular order)

1. Max Strength
2. Hard Work
3. Pyramids
4. Pavel's way

**Max Strength**

There is a correlation between maximum strength and muscular endurance. To a layman's eye it doesn't seem to be a coincidence that a lot of the most successful Hyrox athletes are insanely strong. Being strong makes the demands easier but if you think on that for a second its often quoted being able to do 1 rep max lift is not equivalent to be able to doing a large number of reps with a low weight so what's going on here.\
\
There are numerous studies into the connection between maximum strength and muscular endurance. It's seems there is consensus there is a correlation but they are not agreed why and to what degree. 

In the following (paper)[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263541777*Maximum_strength_and_strength_training*-_A_relationship_to_endurance] makes a few conclusions. The correlation between maximum strength and muscular endurance is likely stronger for high intensity workouts (Yes Hyrox is high intensity!) the volume of strength training plays a factor in muscular endurance.  Although typical strength training does not increase your vo2 max one theory is that stronger athletes are more efficient or economical in their movements making endurance exercises easier with a lower weight. \
\
The relationship between strength and power, increase you maximal strength often is accompanied by increases in power or force development making. It is possible these adaptations can increase endurance.\

I can tell you from first hand experience just trying to do 100 sandbag lunges everyday isnt necessarily the best way to go about trying to master the station. There is of course a time and a place for such things but most of us have limited time to train for events like Hyrox and this is not the most optimal way.

**As the saying quality over quantity might be quality with heavy weights has some reprecocial effect.**
