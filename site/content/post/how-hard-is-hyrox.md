The hardest thing I have ever done but...

In order to answer this question we can look at whats needed. 

A hyrox is a power endurance race but you 

Endurance 

You will need to run ~8.7k if you can't do that you will struggle

 Strength

Pushing sleds on hyrox carpet requires significiant single leg strength 

Lunges requires 







## Recreating the Feeling

Doing 500m ski erg, 500 run etc in the gym can leave you thinking you can easily do a Hyrox. You are wrong. 

You must recreate the feeling of Hyrox every so often to know how hard a Hyrox is actually and how far away from being ready. 

It's similar to training for a running distance, you may run a competition pace run at the distance required to see 'where you are at' but you are unlikely to run a half marathon everyday when training for one.

You can only recreating the feeling by doing a hyrox sim, a PFT with others or a Hyrox Class. Having to workout with others can make you push and compete more than on your own.



## **Pacing**

Pacing your Hyrox is very hard, you will likely not run a Hyrox at your 10k pace and you need to be very careful not to red line your heart rate. If you for example go too hard on the sleds and can't run after you have effectively ruined your race very early. On the other hand, if you are taking breaks it is very easy to take way too long. You need a game plan and you need to stick to it.

Remember over 50% of the race is running ... you need to be able to run ... compromised!

Setting the correct pacing per station is very hard!

## The Stations

You will likely have stations because of your physical attributes (short, tall, skinny, heavy etc) that you are good at and others that you are relatively bad at.

I don't believe I have ever met someone that says they like wall balls and thats their best exercise. Because of the positioning of this exercise it is even worse.

The wall balls are hard and you will need to give them significant attention.

Recreating the feeling of the sleds with the Hyrox carpet is extremely difficult, pushing/pulling the same weight in the gym is not the same. 

Generally if you are tall you have advantages in ski erg, wall balls, rowing.

If you are strong you can hammer the sleds then you are have an advantage over others.

If you are short burpees will likely be easier on you then if you are bigger.

Don't make it harder on yourself on competition day make sure you train your weakness more than your strengths
