In order to answer this question we can look at whats needed 





## Stations

You will likely have stations because of your physical attributes (short, tall, skinny, heavy etc) that you are good and others that you are bad at.

I don't believe I have ever met someone that says they like wall balls and thats their best exercise. Because of the positioning of this exercise it is even worse.

The wall balls are hard and you will need to give them significiant atttention.



Generally if you are tall you have advantages in ski erg, wall balls   you will have some advantage.

If you are strong you are hammer the sleds then you are have an advantage over others.

If you are short burpees will likely be easier on you then the bigger.







Don't make it harder on yourself on competition day make sure you train your weakness more than your strengths
