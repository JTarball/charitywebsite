In order to answer this question we can look at whats needed. A hyrox is a power endurance race but you 

Endurance 

You will need to run ~8.7k if you can't do that you will struggle

 Strength

Pushing sleds on hyrox carpet requires significiant single leg strength 

Lunges requires 







**Pacing**

Pacing your Hyrox is very hard, you will likely not run a Hyrox at your 10k pace and you need to be very careful not to red line your heart rate. If you for example go to hard on the sleds and can't run after you have effectively ruined your race very early. On the other hand, if you are taking breaks it is very easy to take way too long. You need a game plan and you need to stick to it.

Remember over 50% of the race is running ... you need to be able to run ... compromised!





## Stations

You will likely have stations because of your physical attributes (short, tall, skinny, heavy etc) that you are good and others that you are bad at.

I don't believe I have ever met someone that says they like wall balls and thats their best exercise. Because of the positioning of this exercise it is even worse.

The wall balls are hard and you will need to give them significiant atttention.



Generally if you are tall you have advantages in ski erg, wall balls   you will have some advantage.

If you are strong you are hammer the sleds then you are have an advantage over others.

If you are short burpees will likely be easier on you then the bigger.







Don't make it harder on yourself on competition day make sure you train your weakness more than your strengths
