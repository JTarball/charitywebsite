[What is Hyrox?](/post/what-is-hyrox/)

[How Hard is a Hyrox?](/post/how-hard-is-hyrox/)

## **Beginner Guide**

Hyrox is a power endurance event held exclusively indoors.

It encompasses a number of strength exercises and running.

When you first sign up it can feel like a bit overwhelming. It will feel as though you need to improve a neverending list of areas:

 * Rowing Technique
 * Ski Erg Technique
 * Strength
 * Running
 * Power Endurance
 * Sled Technique
 * Wall Ball Technique
 * Burpee Technique
 * Muscular Endurance
 * ... 

If this is your first time you will likely only have between 12-16 weeks maximum to train for this having likely been persuaded by a friend. 

It's hard to know where to start.

I will make it simple for you with the following statements:

- Running is over 50% of the event 
- Wall Balls after 7 exercises and 8k running sucks
- You will really only be able to really focus on **one** aspect of your training. 

***You should understand what that is and decide now.***

***You will of course get better at everything by race day but you will only likely be able to be great at one of the exercises given the time span. My advice for beginners is to focus on the running especially if you don't have a running background.***

- Decide what your goal is

***Is it a time or just finishing - this has a huge impact on the structure of your training***

## Quick Start

* Workout whether you should focus on strength or running first

  * If you are a runner, focus on basic strength first
  * If you have no base it is up to you but running is probably the best option
  * If you are a rugby player, rower, cyclist etc. you will need to need to decide for yourself if your aerobic base in running is good enough
* While you are in your first cycle of training:

***Don't get stuck by indecision - You dont need every cycle structured before beginning your first***

  * Structure your training (See how [here](/post/how-to-structure-your-hyrox-training))
  * Find out when you can & can't train

***Everyone commitments are different you need to tailor your training to work in your schedule.***
* Get on social media  (See who to follow [here](/post/who-should-be-following))
* If any of your friends are also competing make sure you keep in regular contact to share tips, strategy and motivation

## Longer Guide
