## H﻿yrox Race Format

H﻿yrox has several different formats:

* O﻿pen
* I﻿ndividual Pro
* D﻿oubles
* R﻿elay



**O﻿pen**:  Individually take on the Hyrox Standard Format

**P﻿ro**: For experienced racers, this format introduces heavier weights to provide more of a challenge

**D﻿oubles**: A tag team of either mixed, male, female. Defaults to men standards if doing mixed doubles. Individuals are allowed to split up the exercises as much or little as needed but both participants must complete all of the 8k+ running.

**N﻿ote**: There is different standards for men / women e.g. 4kg wall ball vs 6kg



## H﻿ow do I explain this to my friends?

U﻿rm.. it is difficult. 

I﻿t's a functional fitness race that is mostly closely aligned to crossfit, spartan, tough mudder however it takes place indoors with a closer alignment to what people are doing in the gym.

\
I﻿ often just explain the race format that's often enough to get it across to the person that its bloody hard! 

\
*P﻿ro tip: It's a great way to memorise the station order!*
