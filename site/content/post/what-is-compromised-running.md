Coined supposedly by The Running Public's Brakken Kraker, 

It esentially means doing running before and after doing something else, this could be sterngth based, bodyweight, anything that is a different discipline. 

Running after doing "something else" is a different feeling quite often you can't run at the same intensity if you hadn't done the "something else". Your legs could be very tired or your heart rate could have jumped.

For those that have even "hit the wall" during a marathon, it's very hard to run as you were before.



## Why is it so important for Hyrox?

You need to be able to run after 

When you push the sled, your heart rate will spike and overtime your legs will build lactic.  

If you can't run afterwards or do not understand the feeling you will find Hyrox very difficult.

It has be known to ruin people hyrox race, 



It's important to understand that you are not running a 8k race in Hyrox ... you are running 8k compromised. This means you will not run Hyrox at your 10k pace most likely .. you will probably be slower.

You must understand the feeling and mentally be prepared for how to overcome it. This takes practice and mental fortitude.

## How do I get better at compromised running?





## How often

It is dependent on the athlete but just like an interval speed run when running training you do NOT want to do it everyday and you will play with intensity/volume depending on what cycle of training. 

Once a week is more than enough. 

When we talk compromised the classic/sexy association is that of a strength/power based exercise with that of a run. Most closely aligned with crossfit however that doesn't need to be the case. 

You can be smart and do some workouts as recovery as some Hyrox stations are more cardio that strength based. If you still do some compromised works that have less impact physical but help to increase your cardio specifically with burpees, ski erg, rowing. 

E.g. If you are legs are hammered from the impact of a long run you can mix ski ergs, cycle and a run on the treadmill to increase your cardio without the impact and poundering of a run outside.
