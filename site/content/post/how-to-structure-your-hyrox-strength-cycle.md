In previous articles we touched on why it's important to focus on strength in at least one of your cycles.

## Key Points

* 3x3 or 5x5 reps
* Focus on the main exercises
* Consider the posterior chain
* Single Leg Strength is the incredibly important for Hyrox more so than Push/Pull
* You want progressive overload and incremental gains

## How to Structure

The important thing to remember is that you don't want to layer other aspects of Hyrox in this cycle. On your days you can keep your aerobic base maintained and high but focus purely on strength in your gym workouts. To get strong you need to focus purely on strength.

For your strength cycle you don't need to overcomplicate it focus on some core exercises which strength the legs and the posterior chain. If you already have a general plan stick to that as long as the two points are covered you should be fine.

The following articles go into more depth on the exercises you can do to increase your max strength as well as some other factors that can be tweaked/manulitplated such as Time under Tension, Reps.

What is the Posterior Chain

## Baseline Testing

This is not something I have personally done, but I do know people that have and it's normally something that the trainers will suggest. 

Event for just mental motivation benchmarking for hybrid training can be a good idea. You can see the progress you have made by period benchmarking.

Some example benchmarks:

* 3 Rep Max Deadlift
* 5k Row Test (include an easy warmup)
* Max Strict Pull ups
* 5 Min Max Rep Burpees over a bar/rower (so you are jumping)
* 3 Rep Max Bench Press
* 2K Row
* 2K SkiErg
