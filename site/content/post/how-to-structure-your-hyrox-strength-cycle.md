In previous articles we touched on why it's important to focus on strength in at least one of your cycles.

## Key Points

- 3x3 or 5x5 reps
- Focus on the main exercises
- Consider the posterior chain


## How to Structure


The important thing to remember is that you don't want to layer other aspects of Hyrox in this cycle. On your days you can keep your aerobic base maintained and high but focus purely on strength in your gym workouts. To get strong you need to focus purely on strength.


## Baseline Testing

This is not something I have personally done, but I do know people that have and it's normally something that the professionals will suggest. It could just all be for mental motivation but get a benchmark for hybrid training can be a good idea.

Some example benchmarks:

- 3 Rep Max Deadlift
- 5k Row Test (include an easy warmup)
- Max Strict Pullup
- 5 Min Max Rep Burpees over a bar/rower (so you are jumping)
- 3 Rep Max Bench Press
- 2K Row
- 2K SkiErg
