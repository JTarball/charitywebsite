In previous articles we touched on why it's important to focus on strength in at least one of your cycles.

## Key Points

* 3x3 or 5x5 reps
* Focus on some a minimal set of exercises
* Consider the posterior chain
* Single Leg Strength is the incredibly important for Hyrox more so than Push/Pull
* You want progressive overload and aim for incremental gains

<br />

**Summary**: Don't overcomplicate select one or two from each category.

* Aim for small increment changes 
* Consider the occasional variations: single leg strength, slow eccentrics 

## How to Structure

For your strength cycle you don't need to overcomplicate it. Focus on a few exercises which strengthen the legs and the posterior chain. If you already have a general plan stick to that as long as the two points are covered you should be fine.

[What is the Posterior Chain](https://www.compromisedrunning.com/post/what-is-the-posterior-chain/)

The important thing to remember is that you don't want to layer other aspects of Hyrox in this cycle. On your off-days you can keep your aerobic base maintained and high but focus purely on strength in your gym workouts. **To get strong you need to focus purely on strength.**

As mentioned previously, strength can take years to maximise and the connectivity tissues can take a while to form however even so ... you can't neglect this cycle; It is fundamental!

It's simple:

* Workout 2/3 times a week
* Decide whether to split push/pull & lower or do combined. If beginner do a combined strength workout.

Example of combined strength workout:

* Choose 1-2 main exercises (See Strength Exercise Guide) targeting:
  * Posterior Chain 

* Then 1-2 Assessory Exercises for:
  * Horizontal Pull
  * Vertical Pull
  * Horizontal Push
  * Vertical Push      
  * Core

Tip: You can optionally splice in some plyometric/power exercises to set the foundations for some Hyrox specific movements in future mesocycles.

The following articles go into more depth on the exercises you can do to increase your max strength as well as some touch some other areas that can be tweaked/manulitplated such as Time under Tension, Reps.



### Don't Forget  Single Leg Strength

Most likely if you are beginner the best bang for buck is the back squat.

Just be aware that you will eventually need to give some attention to single leg exercises e.g. split squats, romanian split squat, single leg romanian deadlifts.

### Bodyweight Strength Training

Yes, of course you can build massive strength with just bodyweight exercises however this can take a long time to form. If you not already an advanced bodyweight practitioner I would not remember focusing on bodyweight exercises. Hyrox weights are heavy and if you have only 12-16 weeks you need to hit some heavy weights to see big gains!

## Baseline Testing

This is not something I have personally done, but I do know people that have and it's normally something that the trainers will suggest. If you have the time run some baseline tests to give you some data you can compare against in the future.

Even if for just mental motivation benchmarking for hybrid training can be a good idea. 

You can see the progress you have made by period benchmarking between attempts.

Some example benchmarks:

* 3 Rep Max Deadlift
* 5k Row Test (include an easy warmup)
* Max Strict Pull ups
* 5 Min Max Rep Burpees over a bar/rower (so you are jumping)
* 3 Rep Max Bench Press
* 2K Row
* 2K SkiErg
