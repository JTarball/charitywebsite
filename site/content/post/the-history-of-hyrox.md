## History

Hyrox was fï»¿ounded by Christian Toetzke, together with the marketing icon Michael Trautmann and x3 Olympic Medallist Moritz Fuerste in Germany. 

Since it's first event it has experienced massive growth in Europe and the US.

### Origins

Christian Toetzke having spent years organising mass participant cycling events came across an intriguing piece of research stating that over 50% of people in Germany now say their sport is "working out". 

The lightbulb moment was that there was no competition designed for people that would train fitness every day in a gym, even though was a large amount of people called it their 'sport'.

> People have a much deeper awareness of their fitness and health now,


> And they want to stay in shape for their livelihood, and they also want to join or rejoin communities that are associated with fitness.

> There is an appetite for these kinds of things I am seeing now that I have never seen before in my life.

After some trial and error the Hyrox competition format was formed. The key was designing a format that everyone could do even if it required significiant time and not including stations that people were physically incapable of doing e.g. monkey bars. 

*If you don't have the physical pulling strength for monkey bars no matter the time you will not be able to get pass the station.*

The first ever Hyrox event was held in Hamburg, Germany in 2018.


### 2019-2023

In order to test the market in the USA Hyrox staged a number of competitions across various states. 

In late 2019, Miami and New York City held their first U.S. events. Chicago then followed by kicking off the 2020 season.

As 2020 season continued Covid came as a large blow to large indoor events like Hyrox, however lessons were learnt leading to better events in 21/22 seasons. 

*It should be noted that as a new sport Hyrox events also saw some improvements during this time with improvements in form standards, standardisation of sleds etc.*

### 2023 onwards

In 2023, there will be expansions into Denmark, Sweden, Greece and the Middle East.
