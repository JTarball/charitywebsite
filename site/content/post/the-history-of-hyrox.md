Fï»¿ounded by Christian Toetzke, together with the marketing icon Michael Trautmann and x3 Olympic Medallist and World Champion, Moritz Fuerste, originating in Germany it has experienced massive growth in Europe and the US.

Christian Toetzke having spent years organising mass pariticipant cycling events came around a piece of research in Germany stating that over 50% of people now say their sport is working out. 

The lightbulb moment was that there was no competition designed for people that would train fitness every day in the gym .

The first ever Hyrox was held in Hamburg, Germany in 2018.

Of course as an indoor event Covid was a large blow to large indoor events business but lessons were learnt.

He really believes HYROX is a new global Sport of Fitness racing.

In 2023 there will be big expansions into Denmark and Sweden, Greece and Middle East all with first events next season. Spain is growing from one event this past season to now 5 including iconic Barcelona.
