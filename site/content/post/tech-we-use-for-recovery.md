As everyone knows recovery is a very important aspect of training and one that everyones knows to do but find hard to optimise and get right. A discussion into different forms of recovery are well beyond the bounds of this article instead we look at forms of tech we can use the help with recovery.



## Power Dot 

This is my no.1 tech for recovery and now is the only tech I use for recovery (I try and optimise in other ways). The Power Dot just seems to work

It is claimed that it can be used for improving performance.. this is lightly a more dubious claim. I saw no signs of this from its use but without some controlled scientific experiments it is a hard one to say with certaincy.

Looking at the science I could see how it might be able to relax the muscles 

The power dot however really comes into its own when it comes to active recovery, using the power dot while watching TV is soo much more convienient than a hour long stretch and cool down routine after a heavy functional workout or long run.

This tech just works and doesnt just feel like a placebo effect. To be clear there is no way to get around but there has been times because of the fact that I have just picked up running again where my calves feel like granite before a run. Warming them up using the power dot I have effect so much better.







## Compression Boots

\
Massage Guns



Foam Roller

You might be ask why a roller would be included in this list however given the fact that you can get motorised version I decided to include it in the list.
