As everyone knows recovery is a very important aspect of training and one that everyones knows to do but finds hard to optimise and get right. 

A discussion into different forms of recovery are well beyond the bounds of this article. Instead we look at forms of tech we can use the aid with recovery.

## Power Dot

This is my no.1 tech for recovery and now the only tech I use for recovery (I try and optimise in other ways).

The Power Dot just seems to work.

This tech just works and doesnt just feel like a placebo effect. To be clear there is no way to get around extensive fatigue but there has been times because of the fact that I have just picked up running again where my calves feel like granite before a run. Warming them up using the power dot I have effect so much better on my run. Looking at the science I could see how it might be able to relax the muscles.

It is claimed that it can be used for improving performance.. this is lightly a more dubious claim. I saw no signs of this from its use but without some sort of controlled scientific experiments it is a hard to say it doesnt with certaincy. 

The power dot really comes into its own when it comes to active recovery, using the power dot while watching TV is soo much more convienient than a hour long stretch and cool down routine after a heavy functional workout or long run. This is worth its more in gold!

## Compression Boots

If you have the money compression boots are the best tech for recovery. 

Used by professsional athletes such as Lebron James.

## Foam Roller

You might be ask why a roller would be included in this list however given the fact that you can get motorised version I decided to include it in the list.

The simple fact is there is nothing better (other than massages) for releasing your muscles tightness and aiding in your active recovery.
