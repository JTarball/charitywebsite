## Watches 

@ compromisedrunning we love garmin watches. 

Neead a non-nonsense, relatively cheap watch you can't go wrong with the forerunner series.  Split times, vo2 tracking, heart rate optical sensor.

I have three pairs of these trousers,the most comfortable veratile trouser I have.

Ran a half marathon, power yoga, lazyed about the house.

Literally my favourite 

Well made & can even be used as an extra layer when you are getting from a & b and will be wearing shorts e..g gym, footie

Tracksmith's Session Shorts 





The ttrac

Unfortunately they are not the cheapest on the market but the pure comfort and quality makes it totally worth it.

The carry capability is not the greatest in the market but personally its enough for any gels you may carry 





## Gels



Maurten is simply the best gels I have used, it should be noted that this can be a personal thing. I have known people to have issues with various gels in terms of their digestive system, I never had however if you are one of them note that maurten gels are different 'hyrogel' easier on your system during a run.
