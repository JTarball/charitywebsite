Y﻿ou can't really even fail at HYROX unless you give up which if you are reading this article you are mostly likely not going to do. 

H﻿ere is my top ten things to do on Hyrox Race Day so 

1. **Taper**

   U﻿ntrained and push too hard in the week before your race day

2. H﻿ave no mental game or game plan at all
3. **E﻿xperiment with new equipment**
4. **T﻿ry foodspring supplements for the first time on race day**
5. R﻿un out the Tunnel thinking its a 400m sprint

I﻿gnore all sane advice and run your PB in your first K

1. R﻿ed light to early
2. H﻿it a sled wall
3. T﻿rip on the Rope
4. F﻿ail at Basic Mathematics
5. G﻿uzzle Water like you are in the Sahara

T﻿he reason why everyone is shirtless must be because we are in desert.

1. G﻿o cowboy on Hyrox Movement Standards
2. P﻿anic at the Wall Ball Station
3. I﻿gnore No Reps

V﻿olunteers can't count surely.
