You can't really even fail at HYROX unless you give up which if you are reading this article you are mostly likely not going to do. 

Here is my top things NOT to do on Hyrox Race Day: 



1. **Not Tapering**

   *Untrained and pushing too hard in the week before your race day*
2. **Have no mental game or game plan at all**

3. **Experiment with new equipment**

   *Wear new running shoes for the first time on race day. What could possible go wrong?*
4. **Try foodspring supplements for the first time on race day**

   *It's free ...*
5. **Run out the Tunnel thinking its a 400m sprint**

   *Ignore all sane advice and run your PB in your first K*
6. **Red light too early**

   *Zone 5 heart rate is good right?*
7. **Hit a sled wall**\
   \
   *This carpet feels like sandpaper*
8. **Trip on the sled rope**

   *The row comes after farmers carry .. 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 5*
10. **Guzzle Water like you are in the Sahara**\

    *</div>*\
    \
    *In the roxzone see every refreshment tables as an excuse to rest and drink the whole cup of water.*

    *The reason why everyone is shirtless must be because we are in desert, right?*
11. **Go cowboy on hyrox movement standards**

    *Burpee, fall forward, reach as far as possible, take a step*

    *Lunge, drop the sandbag and claim ignorance*

    *Lunge, dont stand up, lunge*
12. **Panic at the Wall Ball Station**

    ![](img/img-20221124-wa0005.jpg)

    *That target looks really high*
13. **Ignore No Reps**

    *Volunteers can't count surely.*
14. **Like to watch the wall balls bounce**

    *I miss basketball ...*
