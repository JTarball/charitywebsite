Structure your training for Hyrox is the most important thing you need to do. It will keep you motivated and ensure you are not doing 

Mostly likely you do not have 



If you have an extended period of time then you have the time for your body to adapt.



To put simply you answer/do the following 

1. What are you / do you have a background?

2.  Analyse how much time you have and demands?

3. Understand Periodisation 

3. Choose your periodisation

3. Find periodic tests / Do not ignore your weakness





## Understanding Your Background



### If you are a complete beginner

### If you have a running background 

### If you have a strength background





## Under Periodisation 

I could probably start talking about mesocycles, macrocycles, microcycles but the reality this is very simple. 

You need 

Can you combine several things at once? Yes you can but it will not have.

There are various s





Strength Periodisation 

This is the most well known, frankly so much so I will keep it short.



This is a foundation, so much so that if you look at a lot of top Hyrox athletes in the off season they are not training Hyrox specific movements and workouts. They are often working on basic strength or isolated competencies. 





Remember in order to get good results and to actually get good at something you need to focus on it. 





See article: Does max strength correlate to strength endurance





## Analyse how much time you have and demands?

How much time do you have before your race? Ideally you will have between 8-12 weeks. Ideally you would have between 12 - 16 weeks. 

Note: Ideally if you are begineer or lacking in strength you may need a lot longer. Do not use this as an excuse not to do Hyrox I am just saying this is about the journey not the destination. Maximising strength can take a year or two, often connective tissues take this long to see results. The good news is that if you are new to strength exercises you will mostly likely see massive gains as a novice, it's a lot harder for experienced gym goers.

If you have less than 8 weeks I am sorry to say that's not enough time in my opinion excluding if you are an experienced athlete or have strong core competanecies in running or strength. Don't get me wrong you can muddle your way through Hyrox but you won't see the results of any of your work.  With less than 8 weeks you are likely to overtrain or risk injury in order to speed up your training before your race.

You may ask yourself what do I need to be to compete as a Hyrox athlete. Being from the UK, I think the easiest answer that question would be to say that you want the characteristics of a rugby player. Rugby players need to be able to run for the entire game, show explosive speed at time, core strength and power in various stages of a match. This amounts to **power endurance**, this is exactly what the demands of Hyrox.

Does that mean you should start playing Rugby.. well no but hopefully I have gotten my point across.
