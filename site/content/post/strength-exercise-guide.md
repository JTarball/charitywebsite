The base categories for basic strength are:

* Vertical Pull
* Horizontal Pull
* Vertical Push
* Horizontal Push
* Core Strength

Don't overcomplicate select one or two from each category.

* Aim for small increment changes 
* Consider the occasional variations: single leg strength, slow eccentrics 

## Vertical Pulls

* Weighted Pullups

### Weighted Pull Ups

Weight pull ups should be on top spot for vertical pull exercises as:
 - They are an exercise with a large range of motion 
 - Hit a large amount of muscle mass

You can experiment with two grip positions:
 - pronated
 - neutral

And two grip widths:
 - regular
 - width

Goals for each rep:

* Keep a neutral spine
* Engain your back muscles by retracting your scapula
* Reach a full hang at the bottom of each rep
* DO NOT focus on getting your chest to touch the bar at the top

#### Regression

If you can't perform weighted pullups try one of the following:

* Negative Weighted Pullups
* Pullups
* Negative Pullups
* Scapula Pullups
* Bodyweight Rows

#### Progression

Assisted One-Arm Pullup

## Horizontal Pulls

* Bent-over Row
* Kroc Row
* Chin up


### Bent-over Row

This exercise is a great one for building sled pull strength.

### Kroc Row

A variation of bent over row with dumbbells, going heavy pay dividends here.

### Chin up

A variation of the pullups were you using a supinated grip (facing you).

Generally for most people this is easier than the pullup given the movement engages your biceps more.

## Vertical Push

 - Overhead Press / Strict Press
 - Seated Dumbbell Shoulder Press
 - Arnold Press
 - Landmine Press


### Overhead Press / Strict Press

### Seated Dumbbell Shoulder Press

### Arnold Press

### Landmine Press

## Horizontal Push

* Bench Press
* Pushup

### Pushup

#### Regression

* Knee Pushups

#### Progression

* Pseudo Planche Pushup
* Hand Release Pushups



## Posterior Chain

### Rack Pulls

The top exercise for the posterior chain is the deadlift however given the risks associated with the exercise I prefer rack pulls. Unless you are someone that trains competitively in deadlifts or has a lot of experience (and thus good technque) the risk to reward ratio is far too high. Noone wants a lower back injury, its far safer to do a romanian deadlift or a rackpull.

Rack Pull is essentially a deadlift variation where you perform the top part of the movement.

Goals for each rep:

* Position the barbell on a squat rack just above the knee
* Inhale, bend your knees slightly when gripping the bar and lift
* Hold the weight at the top
* Keep your back straight when lowering

### Good Mornings

### Pullups

Although stated in above in the vertical pull section, pullups are a great way to strength your upper posterior chain.

## Quick Reminder on Use

* Minimize the number of exercises for simplicity
* You want to look for small incremental strength gains by increasing load
* Improve technique in the exercises overtime

Remember ensure you get your calories, recovery and protein in!
