The short answer is yes but it will be difficult and you will need to train with conviction. But that's why we sign up for things like this because they are hard and there is a sense of accomplishment at the end.

Should be noted that by "begineer" I am talking about people that have never done a Hyrox or equivalent before and are generally not in shape and do not have a background of strength or running.\
\
I recommend doubles for those competing for the first time as the demands are just easier.

To really answer this question, just consider the simple question "Can you run a half marathon as a beginner" the short answer is yes but it will be awful and you will need to work. 

My advice just go for it. Make sure you have at least 12 weeks if you don't have a strength or running background.

Sign up. 

It will keep you motivated and make it real. Don't wait.
