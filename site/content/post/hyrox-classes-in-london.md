It can be important to test your current fitness at various points in your training.

Hyrox simulation are great but you can never recreate the feeling when others are involved this is why it can be a good idea to find something that is at least similiar. 

Here are some classes/eqivalent you can do in London:

## Hyrox PFTs - Hyrox Global Tour

Hyrox do a UK tour across multiple gyms periodically.

Some hyrox PFTs have been held:

- f45 Kensington Olympia
- Crank Peckham


## Milo and the Bull

Milo and the Bull Clapham performed by the great Josh Cooper.

The environment is soo welcoming and the advice I was given for Hyrox was invaluable. Highly recommended.

This was my first introduction to a proper Hyrox level workout, to say it was a shock would be the biggest understatement of the century.

For non-hyrox stuff they also do power yoga, strength and other classes in their clapham and peckham branch.

Note that the hyrox specific classes are only done periodic.
